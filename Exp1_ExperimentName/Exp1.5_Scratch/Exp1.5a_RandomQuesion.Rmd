# Information 

Here is a scratch pad for Exploratory Data Analysis. Have fun spelunking!

## Load the data
```{r}
# by csv or Rdata
# df <- read.csv(paste0(deidentified_data_folder,"file.csv"), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# load("Support/Rdata/RELMS_201516_cleaned_dfs.Rdata")
```

## Analyze the data

This is going to look pretty different for each project, but it should follow the same basic structure of clear headings.  A good way to do that is organize by test, question, or hypothesis

## H.1) My first hypothesis is X

```{r}

```


## Write files for reports
```{r}
# save(list=c("df"), file = "Support/Rdata/Exp1.5a.Rdata")
```
