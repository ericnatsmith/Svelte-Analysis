# Rdata files

Here are where all packages and functions are stored that are needed for analysis.

PackagesFunctions.R loads all needed packages and reads all .R files in the CustomFunctions folder.

You can either use the local files, or load the most up-to-date files placing the R code below at the top of your 0_Header document.
